# ElevenThousandLives
A memorial to lives lost.

Eleven thousand lives. In fact, already many more.

The people who are losing their lives to the IDF's violence are more than just numbers. They have lives, stories to be told, they had hopes, dreams, skills, families.
Too much of the world's political and media powers are dismissing Palestinian sffering, and not giving their mourning the respet it deserves. Each lost person deserves to be memorialised.

Elevent Thousand Lives is a new project to share those stories, so the world can see them.

Support, contribute, resist.
